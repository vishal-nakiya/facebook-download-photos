# This script will download all of your Facebook photos.

I wanted to delete my Facebook profile since I rarely use it anymore. While Facebook allows you to, this does not include photos that you are tagged in. Additionally, some of these photos are not high resolution.

So I decided to write this script to download Facebook photos that you're tagged in and that you have uploaded. This script can also download photos of other Facebook users that have public pictures.

## How to Download All Your Photos from Facebook

**NOTE:** You will need to have Python 3, git, and Google Chrome installed

This code was tested on macOS, but should also work on Windows and Linux.

### 1. Create a virtual Python environment
```
python3 -m venv ~/env/fb
source ~/env/fb/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install the selenium package
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
```
 
### 3. CLICK TO DOWNLOAD
